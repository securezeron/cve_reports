The vulnerability occurs because the extension does not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.", "Impact and Scope": "This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.0 and affects Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 and 4.0. The vulnerability allows an attacker to determine the name of the anonymous account via an RPC POST request to shtml.dll in the /_vti_bin/ virtual directory.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The vulnerability is related to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1190 and T1534. T1190 is used to gain unauthorized access to the system by using an alternate authentication mechanism, and T1534 is used to gain unauthorized access to the system by using a valid account.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs because the Frontpage Server Extensions do not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The attacker can then use the RPC POST request to shtml.dll in the /_vti_bin/ virtual directory to gain unauthorized access to the system.", "Detection": "Detection methods include monitoring for HTTP requests to the /_vti_bin/ virtual directory and monitoring for RPC POST requests to shtml.dll. Additionally, monitoring for unauthorized access to the system and monitoring for unusual activity on the Frontpage Server Extensions.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation strategies include patching the affected software, disabling the Frontpage Server Extensions, and restricting access to the /_vti_bin/ virtual directory.", "Conclusion": "The CVE-2000-0114 vulnerability is a significant threat to the security of the system and should be addressed promptly.
