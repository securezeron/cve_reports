It can be exploited by an attacker with limited privileges.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The vulnerability is related to the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques: T1190, T1502, and T1497.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by the way the neon library handles entity expansion. When an XML document with a large number of nested entity references is processed, the library can consume excessive memory and CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.", "Detection": "The vulnerability can be detected by monitoring application logs for signs of excessive memory and CPU consumption. It can also be detected by using a web application firewall (WAF) that is configured to detect and block crafted XML documents.", "Mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying a patch that fixes the issue, or by using a WAF to detect and block crafted XML documents. Additionally, application developers can take steps to prevent the vulnerability by properly validating and sanitizing input XML documents.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the vulnerability in the neon library is a denial of service vulnerability that can be exploited by sending a crafted XML document with a large number of nested entity references.
