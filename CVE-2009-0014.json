It allows local users to read the Downloads folder, providing potential access to sensitive information.", "Impact and Scope": "The CVSSv2 score for this vulnerability is 2.1. It has a low attack vector and impact, but still poses a risk to local users. The vulnerability occurs when the Folder Manager recreates a deleted Downloads folder with insecure default permissions.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this vulnerability are T1003.005 (Folder Management) and T1021 (Remote System Discovery).", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by the insecure default permission set when recreating a deleted Downloads folder. Local users can exploit this vulnerability by accessing the sensitive information in the Downloads folder.", "Detection": "Detecting this vulnerability can be challenging, but monitoring file access and usage patterns can help identify potential exploitation. Implementing least privilege access controls and monitoring user behavior can also aid in detection.", "Mitigation": "Mitigating this vulnerability involves implementing secure default permissions for the Downloads folder and limiting access to sensitive information. Implementing least privilege access controls and monitoring user behavior can also help prevent exploitation.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the CVE-2009-0014 vulnerability is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows local users to read the Downloads folder.
