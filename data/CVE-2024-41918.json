It is a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack that can be used against the 'Rakuten Ichiba App' for Android and iOS. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious URL to a user, which can then be used to launch a phishing attack. Defending against this kind of attack requires implementing input validation and sanitization on the server-side to prevent malicious input from being injected into the application. Additionally, using a Content Security Policy (CSP) can help prevent XSS attacks by defining which sources of content are allowed to be executed within the application."}, {"techniqueID": "T1048", "comment": "This technique involves using a vulnerable third-party library or component.
