The attack vector is network-based, making it a significant threat to systems that use the affected versions of Go.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques include T1059 and T1047, which are used to execute arbitrary code at build time and achieve persistence on affected systems.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs because the Go command with cgo before Go 1.14.12 and Go 1.15.5 does not properly sanitize input when parsing cgo directives. This allows attackers to inject malicious code into the build process and potentially execute arbitrary code at build time.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability is challenging, but can be achieved by monitoring build processes for suspicious activity and monitoring system logs for signs of malicious code execution.", "Mitigation": "The affected versions of Go must be upgraded to a patched version to mitigate this vulnerability. Additionally, developers should ensure that their build processes are secure and do not allow malicious code to be injected.", "Conclusion": "CVE-2020-28367 is a significant vulnerability that can be used to execute arbitrary code at build time. It is essential to patch affected systems and ensure secure build processes to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "CVE-2020-28367 is a critical vulnerability in the Go command that affects systems that use cgo before Go 1.14.12 and Go 1.15.5. This vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution at build time, making it a significant threat to the integrity of the build process.", "Business Impact": "The business impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it can potentially allow attackers to inject malicious code into the built Go binaries. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and loss of intellectual property.", "Technical Impact": "The technical impact of this vulnerability is high, with a CVSS score of 7.5. The attack vector is network-based, making it a significant threat to systems that use the affected versions of Go.", "Mitigation Strategies": "The recommended mitigation strategy is to patch affected systems and ensure secure build processes. Additionally, system administrators should monitor build processes and system logs for signs of malicious activity.", "Recommendations": "Executives should ensure that their systems are patched and secure, and that their developers are aware of the vulnerability and its potential impact.", "Conclusions": "CVE-2020-28367 is a critical vulnerability that requires immediate attention. Executives should prioritize patching and securing their systems to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability."}}
