This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the bad_password.php page with a malformed email parameter.", "Impact and Scope": "The impact of this vulnerability is low, as it only allows the execution of JavaScript code. However, the scope of the vulnerability is wide, as any user can be affected by this vulnerability, including administrators, users, and guests.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter, T1110 - Using Previously Created Backdoor", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation in the bad_password.php page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which can then be executed within the context of the web site.", "Detection": "This vulnerability can be detected using web application scanners, such as Burp Suite or ZAP. Additionally, monitoring the web site's logs for suspicious activity can also help detect this vulnerability.", "Mitigation": "Implementing Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers can help mitigate this vulnerability by ensuring that only trusted sources can be executed within the context of a web site. Additionally, validating all user input and implementing strict input validation can also help prevent this vulnerability.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, this is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SuperCali version 1.1.0, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
