This information was explained with the reporting party and they chose to ignore it.  ComCity has attempted to reproduce the reported issue using the SQL injection strings and a variety of other SQL injection strings and cannot reproduce the vulnerability on its currently released software.  In addition, the version of the software preported to be affected by this technique is no longer sold or even supported by ComCity and was discontinued nearly a year ago and replaced with a ASP.NET version.  However, we have attempted to reproduce this technique in this old, unsupported release of software that used ASP as well, and cannot reproduce it.\n \nIt is difficult to combat all combinations of SQL Injections through simple sanitation so ComCity discontinued these older ASP based products nearly a year ago.  ASP.NET is less susceptible to SQL Injection and we have informed our customers that the continued use of ASP in the current Internet security climate is unadvisable.  We advise all customers to upgrade to the latest products.  We welcome any report or finding that will help us improve or discover issues unknown to us.  However, the code in question does santize SQL injections and this entire report is inaccurate and was used in conjunction with an extortion request by a 3rd party company solicitating its services.", "lastModified": "2007-06-15T00:00:00"}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV2": [{"source": "nvd@nist.gov", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "LOW", "authentication": "NONE", "confidentialityImpact": "PARTIAL", "integrityImpact": "PARTIAL", "availabilityImpact": "PARTIAL", "baseScore": 7.5}, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "exploitabilityScore": 10.0, "impactScore": 6.4, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": true, "userInteractionRequired": false}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "nvd@nist.gov", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-89"}]}], "configurations": [{"nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "cpeMatch": [{"vulnerable": true, "criteria": "cpe:2.3:a:salescart:shopping_cart:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "C9A3DF46-4626-46D7-82A0-BCDCBD4D81B1"}]}]}], "references": [{"url": "http://osvdb.org/40145", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "http://securityreason.com/securityalert/2758", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/469900/100/0/threaded", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/471409/100/0/threaded", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/471415/100/0/threaded", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/24226", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}, {"url": "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/34567", "source": "cve@mitre.org"}], "techniques": [{"techniqueID": "T1059", "comment": "CVE-2007-2997 -
