This vulnerability can be exploited to gain access to the system, extract sensitive data, and manipulate the application.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5, with a potential attack vector of 'NETWORK'. This means that an attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability remotely, but would require low complexity access.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "TA0003: Command and Control, T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application, T1027: Remote Services, T1036: Data Encoding for Command and Control, T1191: Exploit Public-Facing Application", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs because the Fork CMS application does not properly sanitize user input in the 'language[]' and 'type[]' parameters. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary SQL commands, which can be used to extract sensitive data or manipulate the application.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability may involve monitoring for unusual database activity, monitoring for changes to the application configuration, or monitoring for unusual login activity.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation strategies for this vulnerability may include applying patches to the affected software, implementing input validation and sanitization, or restricting access to the affected system or application.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the CVE-2015-1467 vulnerability is a critical vulnerability that can be exploited to gain access to the system, extract sensitive data, and manipulate the application.
