Gin-vue-admin <= v2.6.5 has SQL injection vulnerability. The SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows users to input data into SQL queries without sufficiently validating or sanitizing the input. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on user input could mean that even a basic form input field can be used to inject arbitrary and potentially dangerous SQL commands. This could lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, data manipulation, or even complete compromise of the database server. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `53d033821` which has been included in release version 2.6.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Gin-vue-admin es un sistema de gesti\u00f3n detr\u00e1s de escena basado en vue y gin. Gin-vue-admin &lt;= v2.6.5 tiene una vulnerabilidad de inyecci\u00f3n SQL. Las vulnerabilidades de inyecci\u00f3n SQL ocurren cuando una aplicaci\u00f3n web permite a los usuarios ingresar datos en consultas SQL sin validar o sanitizar suficientemente la entrada. No aplicar adecuadamente las restricciones a la entrada del usuario podr\u00eda significar que incluso un campo de entrada de formulario b\u00e1sico pueda usarse para inyectar comandos SQL arbitrarios y potencialmente peligrosos. Esto podr\u00eda provocar un acceso no autorizado a la base de datos, una fuga de datos, una manipulaci\u00f3n de datos o incluso un compromiso total del servidor de la base de datos.
