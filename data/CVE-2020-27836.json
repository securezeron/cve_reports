This means that any system that is running cluster-ingress-operator and has not been updated is at risk of being exploited.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The vulnerability is related to the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques: T1190, T1036, and T1021.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by a change in the router-default service that allows access from anywhere. This change was made to allow certain IP source ranges to access resources, but it also allows any attacker to access resources.", "Detection": " Detection of the vulnerability can be performed by monitoring for connections to the router-default service from unknown IP addresses.", "Mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating cluster-ingress-operator to version 4.7 or later. This will remove the vulnerability and prevent it from being exploited.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, CVE-2020-27836 is a critical vulnerability in cluster-ingress-operator that allows an attacker to access resources that would otherwise be restricted to specified IP ranges.
