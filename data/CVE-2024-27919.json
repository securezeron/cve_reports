In versions 1.29.0 and 1.29.1, theEnvoy HTTP/2 protocol stack is vulnerable to the flood of CONTINUATION frames. Envoy's HTTP/2 codec does not reset a request when header map limits have been exceeded. This allows an attacker to send an sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing unlimited memory consumption. This can lead to denial of service through memory exhaustion. Users should upgrade to versions 1.29.2 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood. Note that this vulnerability is a regression in Envoy version 1.29.0 and 1.29.1 only.

En las versiones 1.29.0 y 1.29.1, la pila de protocolos Envoy HTTP/2 es vulnerable a la avalancha de tramas de CONTINUACI\u00d3N. El c\u00f3dec HTTP/2 de Envoy no restablece una solicitud cuando se exceden los l\u00edmites del mapa de encabezado. Esto permite a un atacante enviar una secuencia de tramas CONTINUACI\u00d3N sin que el bit END_HEADERS est\u00e9 configurado, lo que provoca un consumo ilimitado de memoria. Esto puede provocar una denegaci\u00f3n de servicio por agotamiento de la memoria. Los usuarios deben actualizar a las versiones 1.29.2 para mitigar los efectos de la inundaci\u00f3n de CONTINUACI\u00d3N.
