This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when an ACL changes from inactive to active in the running configuration of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL. The reverse condition is also true\u2014traffic that should be permitted could be denied by the configured ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might be protecting. Note: This vulnerability applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic as well as dual-stack ACL configurations in which both IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are configured on an interface."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Una vulnerabilidad en la activaci\u00f3n de una lista de control de acceso (ACL) en el software Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) y el software Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) podr\u00eda permitir que un atacante remoto no autenticado evite la protecci\u00f3n que ofrece una ACL configurada en un dispositivo afectado.
