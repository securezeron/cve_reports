The vulnerability affects remote password attacks, which makes it easier for attackers to gain initial access.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1078 - Account Crackling, T1003 - Credential Dumping, T1076 - Account Persistence.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs because the system does not limit the number of attempts to guess administrative credentials in remote password attacks. This allows attackers to try different combinations of credentials until they find the correct one.", "Detection": "Detecting this vulnerability requires monitoring the system logs for suspicious login attempts and installing security patches to fix the vulnerability.", "Mitigation": "The most effective way to mitigate this vulnerability is to limit the number of attempts to guess administrative credentials in remote password attacks, for example, by implementing a rate limiting feature in the system.", "Conclusion": "The EuroTel ETL3100 versions v01c01 and v01x37 suffer from a vulnerability that allows attackers to guess administrative credentials without limitation.
