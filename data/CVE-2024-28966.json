It is possible to exploit this vulnerability remotely, and an attacker could potentially use it to access restricted resources and modify sensitive data.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this vulnerability are T1190, T1567, T1215, and T1060.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is due to improper access control in the SCG REST API, which allows an attacker to bypass authentication and access the API's functionality. The API does not properly validate and sanitize user input, making it possible to inject malicious data.", "Detection": "To detect this vulnerability, security teams can use network monitoring tools to capture traffic to the SCG REST API and look for unauthorized access attempts. They can also use log analysis tools to detect suspicious activity.", "Mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by configuring the SCG REST API to only be accessible by authorized users, implementing rate limiting and logging on the API, and regularly monitoring and analyzing system logs.", "Conclusion": "CVE-2024-28966 is a moderate-severity vulnerability that could potentially allow unauthorized access and data manipulation.
