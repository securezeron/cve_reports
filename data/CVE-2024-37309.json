A high-risk vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 5.7.2 where the TLS endpoint (port 4200) permits client-initiated renegotiation. In this scenario, an attacker can exploit this feature to repeatedly request renegotiation of security parameters during an ongoing TLS session. This flaw could lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources, resulting in potential server overload and service disruption. The vulnerability was confirmed using an openssl client where the command `R` initiates renegotiation, followed by the server confirming with `RENEGOTIATING`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a denial of service attack by exhausting server CPU resources through repeated TLS renegotiations. This impacts the availability of services running on the affected server, posing a significant risk to operational stability and security. TLS 1.3 explicitly forbids renegotiation, since it closes a window of opportunity for an attack. Version 5.7.2 of CrateDB contains the fix for the issue.\n"}, {"lang": "es", "value": "CrateDB es una base de datos SQL distribuida. Se identific\u00f3 una vulnerabilidad de alto riesgo en versiones anteriores a la 5.7.2 donde el endpoint TLS (puerto 4200) permite la renegociaci\u00f3n iniciada por el cliente. En este escenario, un atacante puede aprovechar esta caracter\u00edstica para solicitar repetidamente la renegociaci\u00f3n de los par\u00e1metros de seguridad durante una sesi\u00f3n TLS en curso. Esta falla podr\u00eda provocar un consumo excesivo de recursos de la CPU, lo que provocar\u00eda una posible sobrecarga del servidor e interrupci\u00f3n del servicio. La vulnerabilidad se confirm\u00f3 utilizando un cliente openssl donde el comando \"R\" inicia la renegociaci\u00f3n, seguido por el servidor que confirma con \"RENEGOTIATING\". Esta vulnerabilidad permite a un atacante realizar un ataque de denegaci\u00f3n de servicio agotando los recursos de la CPU del servidor mediante repetidas renegociaciones de TLS. Esto afecta la disponibilidad de los servicios que se ejecutan en el servidor afectado, lo que representa un riesgo significativo para la estabilidad operativa y la seguridad.
