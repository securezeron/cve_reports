It's usually true, but it's still\npossible that the first interface is bound with another driver via a\nmalformed descriptor.  Then it may lead to a memory corruption, as\nspotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata as\nstruct imon_context object although it's a completely different one\nthat was assigned by another driver.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is\nreally bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem\nabove at the probe time."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "En el kernel de Linux, se resolvi\u00f3 la siguiente vulnerabilidad: medios: imon: corrige el acceso a un recurso no v\u00e1lido para la segunda interfaz.
