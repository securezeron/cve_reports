The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the system by exploiting the mismanagement of shared memory by the PSA Crypto API.", "Impact and Scope": "The impact of this vulnerability is high, as it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely with elevated privileges. This escalation of privileges can allow an attacker to gain control of the system, which can be catastrophic.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this vulnerability are T1190, T1225, T1177, T1222, T1191, and T1179. These techniques relate to the authentication bypass, data encoding and/or escaping, persistence through process modification, data chain/tunneling, authentication bypass using a third-party reliance, and process injection.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs due to the mismanagement of shared memory by the PSA Crypto API. This allows an attacker to manipulate the memory, which can be used to inject malicious code.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability can be done by monitoring the system logs for signs of unusual activity and by conducting regular security audits.", "Mitigation": "The mitigation for this vulnerability is to update the Mbed TLS version to the latest patch level. Additionally, it is recommended to implement a secure coding practice to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the CVE-2024-28960 is a high-severity vulnerability in Mbed TLS 2.18.0 through 2.28.x before 2.28.8 and 3.x before 3.6.0, and Mbed Crypto.
