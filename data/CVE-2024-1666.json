As a result, attackers can bypass the intended account upgrade requirement by directly sending crafted requests to the server, enabling the creation of an unlimited number of radars without payment."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "En lunary-ai/lunary versi\u00f3n 1.0.0, existe una falla de autorizaci\u00f3n que permite la creaci\u00f3n de radares no autorizados.
