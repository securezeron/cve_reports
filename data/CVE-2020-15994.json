It affects Google Chrome prior to version 86.0.4240.99.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": ["T1090", "T1190", "T1204"], "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs when the renderer is allocating and freeing memory for a V8 object, but the object is not properly initialized before being used. This can lead to the use of an uninitialized pointer, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability requires monitoring for memory-related errors and unexpected behavior in the Chrome renderer.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation of this vulnerability requires implementing robust memory handling and validating user input. Additionally, implementing memory protection mechanisms such as ASLR and DEP can also help to prevent exploitation.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome renderer is a critical security issue that requires immediate attention.
