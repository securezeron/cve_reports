The issue arises from the lack of path sanitization when handling the `name` parameter in the `unInstall_binding` function, allowing an attacker to traverse directories and execute arbitrary code by loading a malicious `__init__.py` file. This vulnerability affects the latest version of the software. The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution on the system where parisneo/lollms is deployed."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Una vulnerabilidad en parisneo/lollms, espec\u00edficamente en el endpoint `/unInstall_binding`, permite la ejecuci\u00f3n de c\u00f3digo arbitrario debido a una sanitizaci\u00f3n insuficiente de la entrada del usuario.
