The attack vector is network-based and requires user interaction. The vulnerability can be exploited to run arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, or create a webshell.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1059, T1190, T1027", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation and sanitization in the affected parameters. The exploit can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code, which can then be used to steal sensitive information, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.", "Detection": "The vulnerability can be detected by monitoring for suspicious network traffic patterns, unusual system activity, and/or unusual login activity. Defenders should also monitor for the presence of web shells and unusual system configuration changes.", "Mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the latest security patches, validating and sanitizing user-input data, implementing network segmentation and monitoring for data exfiltration, and implementing host-based intrusion detection systems and monitoring for web shell activity.", "Conclusion": "The CVE-2020-36763 vulnerability in DuxCMS 2.1 is a serious security flaw that can be exploited to run arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, or create a webshell.
