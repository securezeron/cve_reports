This issue was fixed in version 0.55.5. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient handling of concurrent user creation requests, leading to data inconsistencies and potential authentication problems. Specifically, concurrent processes may overwrite or corrupt user data, complicating user identification and posing security risks. This issue is particularly concerning for APIs that rely on usernames as input parameters, such as PUT /api/v1/users/test_race, where it could lead to further complications."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Existe una vulnerabilidad de condici\u00f3n de ejecuci\u00f3n en las versiones de zenml-io/zenml hasta la 0.55.3 incluida, que permite la creaci\u00f3n de m\u00faltiples usuarios con el mismo nombre de usuario cuando las solicitudes se env\u00edan en paralelo. Este problema se solucion\u00f3 en la versi\u00f3n 0.55.5. La vulnerabilidad surge debido al manejo insuficiente de solicitudes simult\u00e1neas de creaci\u00f3n de usuarios, lo que genera inconsistencias en los datos y posibles problemas de autenticaci\u00f3n. Espec\u00edficamente, los procesos simult\u00e1neos pueden sobrescribir o da\u00f1ar los datos del usuario, complicando la identificaci\u00f3n del usuario y planteando riesgos de seguridad.
