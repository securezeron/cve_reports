Users of IPsec transparent encryption in Cilium may be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks that render the transparent encryption ineffective. In particular, Cilium is vulnerable to chosen plaintext, key recovery, replay attacks by a man-in-the-middle attacker. These attacks are possible due to an ESP sequence number collision when multiple nodes are configured with the same key. Fixed versions of Cilium use unique keys for each IPsec tunnel established between nodes, resolving all of the above attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.13, 1.14.9, and 1.15.3."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Cilium es una soluci\u00f3n de redes, observabilidad y seguridad con un plano de datos basado en eBPF. Los usuarios de cifrado transparente IPsec en Cilium pueden ser vulnerables a ataques criptogr\u00e1ficos que hagan que el cifrado transparente sea ineficaz. En particular, Cilium es vulnerable a texto plano elegido, recuperaci\u00f3n de claves y ataques de repetici\u00f3n por parte de un atacante intermediario. Estos ataques son posibles debido a una colisi\u00f3n del n\u00famero de secuencia ESP cuando se configuran varios nodos con la misma clave.
