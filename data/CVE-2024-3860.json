This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.", "Impact and Scope": "The impact of this vulnerability is high, as it allows for remote code execution. The scope of the vulnerability is Firefox prior to version 125. The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The following MITRE ATT&CK techniques are related to this vulnerability: T1190-005, T1190-007, and T1190-011.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs when Firefox initiates an object, which can cause an out-of-memory condition. If the JIT subsequently traces the object, it will crash. This vulnerability is exploitable by crafting a malicious object that can lead to the out-of-memory condition.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability can be done by monitoring system logs for crashes related to object initialization and JIT tracing. Additionally, monitoring system memory usage and process activity can aid in detection.", "Mitigation": "To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to keep Firefox updated to version 125 or later. It is also recommended to validate user input and ensure proper data initialization.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, CVE-2024-3860 is a critical vulnerability in Firefox that poses a significant risk to users. Keeping Firefox updated and validating user input can help mitigate this vulnerability."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "CVE-2024-3860 is a critical vulnerability in Firefox that allows for remote code execution.
