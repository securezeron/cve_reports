The attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.\n"}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Se presenta una vulnerabilidad de tipo cross site scripting (XSS) cuando Microsoft SharePoint Server no sanea apropiadamente una petici\u00f3n web especialmente dise\u00f1ada para un servidor de SharePoint afectado, tambi\u00e9n se conoce como \"Microsoft Office SharePoint XSS Vulnerability\".
