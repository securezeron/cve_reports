This issue may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted container that, when configured to share the same IPC with at least one other container, can create a large number of IPC resources in /dev/shm. The malicious container will continue to exhaust resources until it is out-of-memory (OOM) killed. While the malicious container's cgroup will be removed, the IPC resources it created are not. Those resources are tied to the IPC namespace that will not be removed until all containers using it are stopped, and one non-malicious container is holding the namespace open. The malicious container is restarted, either automatically or by attacker control, repeating the process and increasing the amount of memory consumed. With a container configured to restart always, such as `podman run --restart=always`, this can result in a memory-based denial of service of the system."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Se encontr\u00f3 una falla en Podman. Este problema puede permitir a un atacante crear un contenedor especialmente manipulado que, cuando se configura para compartir el mismo IPC con al menos otro contenedor, puede crear una gran cantidad de recursos de IPC en /dev/shm. El contenedor malicioso continuar\u00e1 agotando recursos hasta que se elimine por falta de memoria (OOM). Si bien se eliminar\u00e1 el cgroup del contenedor malicioso, los recursos de IPC que cre\u00f3 no se eliminar\u00e1n. Esos recursos est\u00e1n vinculados al espacio de nombres IPC que no se eliminar\u00e1 hasta que se detengan todos los contenedores que lo utilizan y un contenedor no malicioso mantenga abierto el espacio de nombres. El contenedor malicioso se reinicia, ya sea autom\u00e1ticamente o por control del atacante, repitiendo el proceso y aumentando la cantidad de memoria consumida.
