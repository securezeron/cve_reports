Como se mencion\u00f3 en el commit anterior, descubrimos r\u00e1pidamente que algunos AP tienen elementos ECSA atascados en su respuesta de sondeo, por lo que no se pueden usar si intentamos conectarnos mientras se realiza CSA, nunca nos conectaremos a dicho AP. Mejore esta situaci\u00f3n verificando m\u00e1s cuidadosamente e ignorando ECSA si cfg80211 ha detectado previamente que el elemento ECSA est\u00e1 atascado en la respuesta de la sonda. Adem\u00e1s, permita conectarse a un AP que est\u00e9 cambiando a un canal que ya est\u00e9 usando, a menos que est\u00e9 usando el modo silencioso.
