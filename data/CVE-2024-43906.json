This means that an attacker would need to have access to the local system to exploit the vulnerability. The impact of this vulnerability is HIGH, making it a serious threat to organizations with sensitive data or high-availability systems.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1190, T1027, T1210, T1191, T1221, T1055, T1060", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer copy operation without checking the size of the input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the kernel. The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a crafted buffer to the drm/admgpu driver.", "Detection": "Detection can be done by monitoring system logs for suspicious buffer copy operations and by implementing a web application firewall to block crafts buffer requests.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation can be done by applying the patch provided by the Linux kernel, and by implementing a web application firewall to block crafts buffer requests.", "Conclusion": "The CVE-2024-43906 is a high-severity vulnerability that allows attackers to cause a high availability impact.
