This means that an unauthenticated attacker with low privileges on the network can potentially exploit the vulnerability.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The vulnerability is related to multiple MITRE ATT&CK techniques, including TA0001, T1190, T1194, and T1199, which are all associated with initial access, persistence, and privilege escalation.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of tapscript policy size limit check, which allows attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code. This can be exploited by sending a specially crafted transaction to the vulnerable system.", "Detection": "Detection of the vulnerability can be challenging, as it requires monitoring for suspicious transactions and analyzing system logs for signs of exploitation.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation strategies for the vulnerability include applying security patches, enforcing tapscript policy size limits, and monitoring system logs for signs of exploitation.", "Conclusion": "The CVE-2024-34149 vulnerability in Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots is a critical issue that requires immediate attention.
