This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 EV chargers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the AppAuthenExchangeRandomNum BLE command. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.
