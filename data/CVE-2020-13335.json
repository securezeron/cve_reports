However, a vulnerability has been discovered in GitLab >=7.12 that allows a user to delete their own account without deleting their group. This vulnerability is known as CVE-2020-13335.", "Impact and Scope": "The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can delete a user account without deleting/destroying their group. This can lead to unauthorized access to the group and its resources. The scope of this vulnerability is limited to GitLab >=7.12.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "TA0001: Initial Access, TA0027: Account Manipulation, TA0028: Permissions Management", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs due to improper group membership validation during user account deletion. When a user deletes their own account, the system does not properly check if the user is a member of a group before deleting the account. This allows an attacker to delete their own account without deleting their group.", "Detection": "The detection of this vulnerability can be done by monitoring for unusual account deletion activity and verifying that the group membership is updated correctly.", "Mitigation": "The mitigation for this vulnerability is to implement proper group membership validation during user account deletion. This can be done by checking if the user is a member of a group before deleting the account.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the vulnerability CVE-2020-13335 in GitLab >=7.12 allows an attacker to delete a user account without deleting/destroying their group. This can lead to unauthorized access to the group and its resources. The mitigation for this vulnerability is to implement proper group membership validation during user account deletion."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "A vulnerability has been discovered in GitLab >=7.12 that allows a user to delete their own account without deleting their group.", "Business Impact": "The business impact of this vulnerability is that it can lead to unauthorized access to group resources and data.", "Technical Impact": "The technical impact of this vulnerability is that it can be exploited to delete a user account without deleting/destroying their group.", "Mitigation Strategies": "Implement proper group membership validation during user account deletion.", "Recommendations": "Recommendations for executives are to prioritize the mitigation of this vulnerability and ensure that proper group membership validation is implemented during user account deletion.", "Conclusions": "In conclusion, the vulnerability CVE-2020-13335 in GitLab >=7.12 is a serious issue that requires immediate attention and mitigation. Executives should prioritize the mitigation of this vulnerability and ensure that proper group membership validation is implemented during user account deletion."}}
