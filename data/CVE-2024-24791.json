An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending \"Expect: 100-continue\" requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "El cliente net/http HTTP/1.1 manej\u00f3 mal el caso en el que un servidor responde a una solicitud con un encabezado \"Expect: 100-continue\" con un estado no informativo (200 o superior).
