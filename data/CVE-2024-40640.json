Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel attack. The use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material. The impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements, as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes.  Additionally, the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the referenced paper. This has been patched in commit 734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272 which has been included in release version 0.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n"}, {"lang": "es", "value": "vodozemac es una implementaci\u00f3n de c\u00f3digo abierto de Olm y Megolm en Rust puro. Las versiones anteriores a la 0.7.0 de vodozemac utilizan una implementaci\u00f3n base64 de tiempo no constante para importar material clave para sesiones de grupo Megolm y claves secretas `PkDecryption` Ed25519.

Potencialmente, esto podr\u00eda proporcionar informaci\u00f3n sobre el material de la clave secreta subyacente.
