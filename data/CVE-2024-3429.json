This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file reading when the application is running on Windows. The issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, enabling attackers to bypass the path traversal protection mechanisms by crafting malicious input. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, information disclosure, and potentially a denial of service (DoS) condition by including numerous large or resource-intensive files. This vulnerability affects the latest version prior to 9.6."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Existe una vulnerabilidad de path traversal en la aplicaci\u00f3n parisneo/lollms, espec\u00edficamente dentro de las funciones `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` y `sanitize_path` en `lollms_core\\lollms\\security.py`. Esta vulnerabilidad permite la lectura arbitraria de archivos cuando la aplicaci\u00f3n se ejecuta en Windows.
