This vulnerability is due to the incorrect deployment of the Object Groups for ACLs feature from Cisco FMC Software to managed FTD devices in high-availability setups. After an affected device is rebooted following Object Groups for ACLs deployment, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured access controls and successfully send traffic to devices that are expected to be protected by the affected device."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Una vulnerabilidad en la funci\u00f3n Grupos de objetos para listas de control de acceso (ACL) del software Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) podr\u00eda permitir que un atacante remoto no autenticado evite los controles de acceso configurados en dispositivos administrados que ejecutan el software Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD).
