An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email that contains a crafted attachment through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to replace any file on the underlying file system. The attacker could then perform any of the following actions: add users with root privileges, modify the device configuration, execute arbitrary code, or cause a permanent denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.\r\n\r Note: Manual intervention is required to recover from the DoS condition. Customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help recover a device in this condition."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Una vulnerabilidad en las funciones de escaneo de contenido y filtrado de mensajes de Cisco Secure Email Gateway podr\u00eda permitir que un atacante remoto no autenticado sobrescriba archivos arbitrarios en el sistema operativo subyacente. Esta vulnerabilidad se debe al manejo inadecuado de los archivos adjuntos de correo electr\u00f3nico cuando el an\u00e1lisis de archivos y los filtros de contenido est\u00e1n habilitados. Un atacante podr\u00eda aprovechar esta vulnerabilidad enviando un correo electr\u00f3nico que contenga un archivo adjunto manipulado a trav\u00e9s de un dispositivo afectado. Un exploit exitoso podr\u00eda permitir al atacante reemplazar cualquier archivo en el sistema de archivos subyacente.
