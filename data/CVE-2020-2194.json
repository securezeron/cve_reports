This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to steal sensitive information, create a reverse shell, or execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable system.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability, which occurs when the user interacts with a website or application that has not been properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.4 and is rated as medium severity. This vulnerability can affect any system running the vulnerable version of the Jenkins ECharts API Plugin.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": ["T1059.001", "T1190", "T1568.001", "T1192"], "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs when the display name of builds in the trend chart is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. The attacker can then use this code to steal sensitive information, create a reverse shell, or execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable system.", "Detection": "To detect this vulnerability, it is recommended to scan for external-facing Jenkins plugins for the presence of the vulnerable version of the ECharts API plugin.", "Mitigation": "To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to update the ECharts API plugin to a version greater than 4.7.0-3, and to scan for and remove any malicious code injected by an attacker.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the CVE-2020-2194 vulnerability in Jenkins ECharts API Plugin is a stored XSS vulnerability that can be exploited to steal sensitive information, create a reverse shell, or execute arbitrary commands on the vulnerable system.
