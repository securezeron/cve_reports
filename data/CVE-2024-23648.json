The password reset functionality sends to the the user requesting a password change an email containing an URL to reset its password. The URL sent contains a unique token, valid during 24 hours, allowing the user to reset its password. This token is highly sensitive ; as an attacker able to retrieve it would be able to resets the user's password. Prior to version 1.2.3, the reset-password URL is crafted using the \"Host\" HTTP header of the request sent to request a password reset. This way, an external attacker could send password requests for users, but specify a \"Host\" header of a website that they control. If the user receiving the mail clicks on the link, the attacker would retrieve the reset token of the victim and perform account takeover. Version 1.2.3 fixes this issue."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "El paquete Admin Classic de Pimcore proporciona una interfaz de usuario backend para Pimcore. La funci\u00f3n de restablecimiento de contrase\u00f1a env\u00eda al usuario que solicita un cambio de contrase\u00f1a un correo electr\u00f3nico que contiene una URL para restablecer su contrase\u00f1a. La URL enviada contiene un token \u00fanico, v\u00e1lido durante 24 horas, que permite al usuario restablecer su contrase\u00f1a. Este token es muy sensible; ya que un atacante capaz de recuperarlo podr\u00eda restablecer la contrase\u00f1a del usuario. Antes de la versi\u00f3n 1.2.3, la URL de restablecimiento de contrase\u00f1a se elabora utilizando el encabezado HTTP \"Host\" de la solicitud enviada para solicitar un restablecimiento de contrase\u00f1a. De esta manera, un atacante externo podr\u00eda enviar solicitudes de contrase\u00f1a para los usuarios, pero especificar un encabezado \"Host\" de un sitio web que controla.
