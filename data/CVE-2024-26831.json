Tenga en cuenta que sock_release() es sincr\u00f3nico pero fput() normalmente retrasa el cierre y la limpieza finales. El retraso no tiene consecuencias en los otros casos que se cambiaron, pero handshake_req_destroy_test1 est\u00e1 probando que handshake_req_cancel() seguido del cierre del archivo realmente llama al m\u00e9todo -&gt;hp_destroy. Por lo tanto, la prueba PTR_EQ al final debe asegurarse de que el cierre final est\u00e9 completo antes de verificar el puntero.
