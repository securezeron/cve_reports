This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the administrator user's password and email address via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This locks the administrator out of the site and prevents them from resetting their password, while granting the attacker access to their account."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "El complemento Classified Listing \u2013 Classified ads &amp; Business Directory Plugin para WordPress es vulnerable a Cross-Site Request Forgery en todas las versiones hasta la 3.0.4 incluida.
