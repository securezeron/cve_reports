This is due to the plugin displaying errors and allowing direct access to the sse.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website."

Esto se debe a que el complemento muestra errores y permite el acceso directo al archivo sse.php. Esto permite que atacantes no autenticados recuperen la ruta completa de la aplicaci\u00f3n web, que puede usarse para ayudar a otros ataques. La informaci\u00f3n mostrada no es \u00fatil por s\u00ed sola y requiere que exista otra vulnerabilidad para que se produzcan da\u00f1os en un sitio web afectado."
