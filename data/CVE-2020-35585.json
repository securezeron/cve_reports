The scope of this vulnerability is global, affecting all systems running the vulnerable version of the Solstice Pod software.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this vulnerability are T1057: Process Injection and T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is due to the use of a weak password in the Solstice Pod software. The password is brute-forced using the '/lookin/info Solstice Open Control API'.", "Detection": "The detection of this vulnerability is difficult, as it requires the attacker to have already gained access to the application. The system logs and network traffic may need to be reviewed to detect the exploitation of this vulnerability.", "Mitigation": "The mitigation of this vulnerability is to update the Solstice Pod software to version 3.3.0 or later. The attacker needs to have already gained access to the application, so changing the password or implementing additional security measures may not be effective.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the CVE-2020-35585 vulnerability is a high-impact remote code execution vulnerability that affects the Solstice Pod software. The detection and mitigation of this vulnerability are difficult, and the attacker needs to have already gained access to the application."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "The CVE-2020-35585 vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Solstice Pod before 3.3.0.
