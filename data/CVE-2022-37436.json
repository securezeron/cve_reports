        "Introduction": "Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.55 contains a vulnerability that allows a malicious backend to cause the response headers to be truncated early, resulting in some headers being incorporated into the response body.",
        "Impact and Scope": "This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3 and can be exploited by both authenticated and unauthenticated attackers. The attack vector is network-based. The vulnerability impacts the Apache HTTP Server and can be exploited to inject malicious code, bypass security controls, and access sensitive information.",
        "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "This vulnerability is related to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Command Injection, Data Encoding, and URL Scan.",
        "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs when a malicious backend sends a truncated response to the Apache HTTP Server, which then incorporates the truncated response into the response body. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code, bypass security controls, and access sensitive information.",
        "Detection": "Detecting this vulnerability requires monitoring the Apache HTTP Server logs for suspicious traffic patterns and analyzing the response bodies for signs of tampering.",
        "Mitigation": "Mitigating this vulnerability requires implementing full-disclosure patching, configuring the Apache HTTP Server to only allow trusted backend connections, and using web application firewalls (WAFs) to restrict allowed inputs.",
        "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the Apache HTTP Server vulnerability CVE-2022-37436 is a high-risk vulnerability that requires immediate attention from security teams. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies can help minimize the risk of exploitation."
