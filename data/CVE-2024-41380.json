This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application, leading to unauthorized data disclosure or theft.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.1 (MEDIUM) with version 3.1, attack vector of NETWORK, and required user interaction. It has a moderate-risk impact, as it can lead to unauthorized data disclosure or theft.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1174, T1046, T1204", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the userfiles/modules/tags/add_tagging_tagged.php module, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need to inject a malicious script into the web application's <script> tags, which would then be executed by the web browser.", "Detection": "Detection of the vulnerability can be done by reviewing the web application's source code and checking for any vulnerable modules or scripts.", "Mitigation": "To mitigate the vulnerability, it is recommended to implement robust input validation and sanitization, as well as limitation of potentially malicious user input. Additionally, it is recommended to update the web application to a newer version that fixes the vulnerability.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the microweber 2.0.16 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is a serious security issue that can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application, leading to unauthorized data disclosure or theft.
