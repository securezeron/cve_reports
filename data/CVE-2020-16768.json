This technique is typically used for post-exploitation, privilege escalation, and meterpreter shell commands. It is often used for executing commands remotely, such as executing arbitrary shell commands, creating and deleting files, and running scripts. It is also used for spawning threads and processes, and for interacting with the Windows registry. The adversary may also use this technique to download and upload files. This technique can be detected by analyzing command-line interfaces, registry keys, and system logs for suspicious activity. Defenders can prevent exploitation by blocking suspicious network traffic, disabling unnecessary services, and implementing strong authentication and access controls.\",\"first_observed\":\"\",\"last_observed\":\"\",\"object_marking_refs\":[],\"related_objects\":[{\"ref\":\"https://example.com/stixbundle/CVE-2020-16768\",\"type\":\"indicator\"}],\"schema_version\":\"2.1\",\"created_by_id\":\"admin\",\"modified_by_id\":\"admin\",\"labels\":\"T1190\",\"revoked\":\"false\",\"false_permanent_ids\":[],\"hashes\":{\"SHA-256\":\"\"},\"tlp\":{\"white\"}},{\"id\":\"https://example.com/stixbundle/stix_course_of_action\",\"type\":\"course-of-action\",\"created_by_ref\":\"https://example.com/stixbundle\",\"created\":\"2021-12-20T23:15:26.227\",\"modified\":\"2023-11-07T03:18:48.953\",\"name\":\"Defending Against T1190\",\"description\":\"Detection and Mitigation Strategies for T1190\",\"first_observed\":\"\",\"last_observed\":\"\",\"object_marking_refs\":[],\"related_objects\":[{\"ref\":\"https://example.com/stixbundle/T1190\",\"type\":\"attack-pattern\"},{\"ref\":\"https://example.com/stixbundle/CVE-2020-16768\",\"type\":\"indicator\"}],\"schema_version\":\"2.1\",\"created_by_id\":\"admin\",\"modified_by_id\":\"admin\",\"labels\":\"\",\"revoked\":\"false\",\"false_permanent_ids\":[],\"hashes\":{\"SHA-256\":\"\"},\"tlp\":{\"white\"}}]},\"relationships\":[{\"id\":\"https://example.com/stixbundle/CVE-2020-16768\",\"type\":\"indicator\",\"to_ids\":[\"https://example.com/stixbundle/T1190\",\"https://example.com/stixbundle/stix_course_of_action\"]},{\"id\":\"https://example.com/stixbundle/T1190\",\"type\":\"attack-pattern\",\"to_ids\":[\"https://example.com/stixbundle/stix_course_of_action\"]},{\"id\":\"https://example.com/stixbundle/stix_course_of_action\",\"type\":\"course-of-action\",\"to_ids\":[\"https://example.com/stixbundle/T1190\",\"https://example.com/stixbundle/CVE-2020-16768\"]}]", "technical_analysis": {"Introduction": "CVE-2020-16768 is a rejected vulnerability in the QCCrypto library that could potentially be exploited by attackers.", "Impact and Scope": "Due to its rejection, there is no CVSS score or attack vector available.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1190 is a related MITRE ATT&CK technique that could be used to exploit the QCCrypto library.", "Technical Details": "The QCCrypto library is a critical component of the Qualcomm Secure Socket Layer (SSL) implementation.
