This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the send_backup_codes_email function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails with arbitrary content to registered users via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator or other registered user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. While a nonce check is present, it is only executed if a nonce is set. By omitting a nonce from the request, the check can be bypassed."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "El complemento WP 2FA \u2013 Two-factor authentication for WordPress para WordPress es vulnerable a Cross-Site Request Forgery en todas las versiones hasta la 2.5.0 incluida.
