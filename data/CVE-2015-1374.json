This vulnerability impacts the admin.php component of version 1.0.4-alpha and allows attackers to hijack administrator authentication.", "Impact and Scope": "The impact of this CVE is Partial (C) with a CVSS 2.0 base score of 6.8. The attack vector is NETWORK and the required user interaction is YES.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1059: Command and Control - Client-Side Skeleton Key, T1046: Web Application Exploitation - Cross-Site Scripting.", "Technical Details": "CSRF vulnerabilities allow attackers to trick users into executing malicious requests on behalf of the targeted site. In this case, the targeted site is the administrator interface of ferretCMS.", "Detection": "Potential indicators of compromise include altered page behavior, unusual user activity, or unexpected login activity. Detection can be enhanced by monitoring network traffic for suspicious requests and monitoring administrator activities.", "Mitigation": "Validating user input, implementing CSRF tokens, and inspecting HTTP requests can help prevent attackers from hijacking administrator authentication. Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP), deploying browser extensions that block malicious scripts, and performing regular software updates can also help mitigate this vulnerability.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the ferretCMS 1.0.4-alpha admin.php component is vulnerable to multiple CSRF attacks, which can be exploited to hijack administrator authentication. Proper mitigation measures, such as input validation and CSRF token implementation, can help prevent this vulnerability from being exploited."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "FerretCMS has been found to be vulnerable to multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, which can potentially allow attackers to hijack administrator authentication.", "Business Impact": "This vulnerability can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ferretCMS-based websites or applications.
