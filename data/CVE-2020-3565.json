The vulnerability exists because TCP Intercept is invoked when the embryonic connection limit is reached, which can cause the underlying detection engine to process the packet incorrectly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of traffic that matches a policy on which TCP Intercept is configured. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to match on an incorrect policy, which could allow the traffic to be forwarded when it should be dropped. In addition, the traffic could incorrectly be dropped."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Una vulnerabilidad en la funcionalidad TCP Intercept de Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software, podr\u00eda permitir a un atacante remoto no autenticado omitir las pol\u00edticas de control de acceso configuradas (incluida la geolocalizaci\u00f3n) y las pol\u00edticas de servicio en un sistema afectado.&#xa0;La vulnerabilidad se presenta porque TCP Intercept es invocado cuando el l\u00edmite de conexi\u00f3n embrionaria es alcanzado, lo que puede causar que el motor de detecci\u00f3n subyacente procese el paquete incorrectamente.&#xa0;Un atacante podr\u00eda explotar esta vulnerabilidad mediante el env\u00edo de un flujo de tr\u00e1fico dise\u00f1ado que coincida con una pol\u00edtica en la que se configura TCP Intercept.&#xa0;Una explotaci\u00f3n con \u00e9xito podr\u00eda permitir a un atacante coincidir con una pol\u00edtica inapropiada, lo que podr\u00eda permitir que el tr\u00e1fico se reenv\u00ede cuando deber\u00eda ser descartado.&#xa0;Adem\u00e1s, el tr\u00e1fico podr\u00eda ser interrumpido incorrectamente"}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "nvd@nist.gov", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 1.4}, {"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 1.4}], "cvssMetricV2": [{"source": "nvd@nist.gov", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "MEDIUM", "authentication": "NONE", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "PARTIAL", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.3}, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "exploitabilityScore": 8.6, "impactScore": 2.9, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": false}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "nvd@nist.gov", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-287"}]}, {"source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-284"}]}], "configurations": [{"nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "cpeMatch": [{"vulnerable": true, "criteria": "cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "6.4.0.8", "matchCriteriaId": "2532F140-2D4A-41BC-A932-ED179B1C26B2"}, {"vulnerable": true, "criteria": "cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "6.5.0", "versionEndExcluding": "6.5.0.4", "matchCriteriaId": "A2B6355D-CD58-4DDE-A9CC-2B957F95CDA1"}, {"vulnerable": true, "criteria": "cpe:2.3:a:cisco:firepower_threat_defense:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "6.5.0.5", "versionEndExcluding": "6.6.0", "matchCriteriaId": "03CCDBE2-4AB6-4818-A954-4CA6F71C803C"}]}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-tcp-intercept-bypass-xG9M3PbY", "source": "ykramarz@cisco.com", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory"]}], "techniques": [{"techniqueID": "T1209", "comment": "CVE-2020-3565 -
