Before 4.0.7, there is a flaw in the Static Libraries analysis section. Specifically, during the extraction of .a extension files, the measure intended to prevent Zip Slip attacks is improperly implemented. Since the implemented measure can be bypassed, the vulnerability allows an attacker to extract files to any desired location within the server running MobSF. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.7."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) es un framework de prueba de penetraci\u00f3n, an\u00e1lisis de malware y evaluaci\u00f3n de seguridad capaz de realizar an\u00e1lisis est\u00e1ticos y din\u00e1micos.
