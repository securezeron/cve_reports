Yet the driver makes such assumption and releases the TD,\nallowing the remaining TRBs to be freed or overwritten by new TDs.\n\nThe xHC should also report completion of the final TRB due to its IOC\nflag being set by us, regardless of prior errors. This event cannot\nbe recognized if the TD has already been freed earlier, resulting in\n\"Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD\" error message.\n\nFix this by reusing the logic for processing isoc Transaction Errors.\nThis also handles hosts which fail to report the final completion.\n\nFix transfer length reporting on Babble errors.

Sin embargo, el conductor hace tal suposici\u00f3n y libera el TD, permitiendo que los TRB restantes sean liberados o sobrescritos por nuevos TD. El xHC tambi\u00e9n debe informar la finalizaci\u00f3n del TRB final debido a que nosotros establecimos la bandera del COI, independientemente de los errores anteriores. Este evento no se puede reconocer si el TD ya se liber\u00f3 anteriormente, lo que genera el mensaje de error \"Evento de transferencia TRB DMA ptr no forma parte del TD actual\". Solucione este problema reutilizando la l\u00f3gica para procesar errores de transacci\u00f3n isoc. Esto tambi\u00e9n maneja los hosts que no informan la finalizaci\u00f3n final.
