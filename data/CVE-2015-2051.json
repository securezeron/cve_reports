It affects the D-Link DIR-645 router with firmware versions 1.04b12 and earlier.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1190, T1027, and T1210", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by an insecure default configuration of the HTTP interface, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary commands. This can be exploited by sending a malicious HTTP GET request to the /HNAP1/Execute action.", "Detection": "Detecting this vulnerability involves monitoring for suspicious HTTP traffic to the router's management interface. Detection systems should be configured to look for traffic patterns that indicate exploitation.", "Mitigation": "The recommended mitigation is to disconnect the router from the network if it is still in use and replace it with a secure alternative. Users should also ensure that the HTTP interface is disabled or configured with proper authentication and authorization measures.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, CVE-2015-2051 is a severe remote code execution vulnerability that affects the D-Link DIR-645 router. The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers, and detection and mitigation are critical to preventing attacks."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "CVE-2015-2051 is a critical security vulnerability in the D-Link DIR-645 router that allows remote code execution. This vulnerability has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the router and its connected devices.", "Business Impact": "The business impact of this vulnerability includes reputational damage, compliance issues, and potential financial losses due to unauthorized access and data breaches.", "Technical Impact": "The technical impact of this vulnerability includes remote code execution, data exfiltration, and potential network exploitation.", "Mitigation Strategies": "The recommended mitigation strategy is to disconnect the router from the network if it is still in use and replace it with a secure alternative.
