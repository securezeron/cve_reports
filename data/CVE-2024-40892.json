Once an attacker gains access to the LAN, they could log into the SSH interface using the provisioned credentials. The license UUID can be acquired through plain-text Bluetooth sniffing, reading the QR code on the bottom of the device, or brute-forcing the UUID (though this is less likely)."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Existe una vulnerabilidad de credencial d\u00e9bil en las versiones del software Firewalla Box anteriores a la 1.979.
