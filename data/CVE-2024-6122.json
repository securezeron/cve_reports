This vulnerability affects NI SystemLink Server 2024 Q1 and prior versions, as well as NI FlexLogger 2023 Q2 and prior versions that installed this shared service.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.5 with a version of 3.1, attack vector of LOCAL, and no user interaction required. This means that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to system information without interacting with the system.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The vulnerability is related to T1134, T1190, and T1387, which are all categories of exploiting vulnerabilities.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect permission in the installation directory for the shared NI SystemLink Server KeyValueDatabase service. This allows an attacker to read and write system files, including configuration files and logs.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability is challenging, as it requires access to system logs and configuration files. However, detection can be improved by monitoring system files and configuring logging and auditing features to detect changes to system files.", "Mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating to a version that fixes the incorrect permission issue, or by disabling the shared service if it is not in use.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, CVE-2024-6122 is a critical vulnerability that affects the NI SystemLink Server KeyValueDatabase service. It allows for information disclosure via local access and can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to system information. Detection and mitigation of this vulnerability are challenging, but can be improved by monitoring system files and configuring logging and auditing features."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "CVE-2024-6122 is a critical vulnerability that affects the NI SystemLink Server KeyValueDatabase service, which is used by many organizations. This vulnerability allows for information disclosure via local access and can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to system information.", "Business Impact": "The business impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive system information. This could result in unauthorized data disclosure, data tampering, or even denial of service attacks.", "Technical Impact": "The technical impact of this vulnerability is also significant, as it allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to system information. This could result in data breaches, unauthorized system modifications, or even system crashes.", "Mitigation Strategies": "The mitigation strategies for this vulnerability are to update to a version that fixes the incorrect permission issue, or to disable the shared service if it is not in use. It is also important to monitor system files and configure logging and auditing features to detect changes to system files.", "Recommendations": "We recommend that organizations update to a version that fixes the incorrect permission issue, or disable the shared service if it is not in use. We also recommend that organizations monitor system files and configure logging and auditing features to detect changes to system files.", "Conclusions": "In conclusion, CVE-2024-6122 is a critical vulnerability that affects the NI SystemLink Server KeyValueDatabase service. It allows for information disclosure via local access and can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to system information.
