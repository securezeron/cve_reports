This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to update plugin settings, which could be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.3 with a low attack vector, making it possible for attackers to exploit it without user interaction. The vulnerability affects all versions of the 360 Javascript Viewer plugin up to and including 1.7.12.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques include T1133, T1078, and T1550, which are all related to the exploitation of the missing capability check and nonce exposure.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by the missing capability check and nonce exposure on several AJAX actions in the 360 Javascript Viewer plugin. This is due to the fact that the plugin does not check the capability of the attacker before allowing the update of plugin settings, making it possible for attackers to bypass the capability check and update the plugin settings without being detected.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability can be done by analyzing the log files for suspicious activity, such as the update of plugin settings by unauthorized users. Additionally, scanning the system for the 360 Javascript Viewer plugin and verifying that it is up to date and patched can help to detect this vulnerability.", "Mitigation": "To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to update the 360 Javascript Viewer plugin to the latest version, which has a fixed capability check and nonce exposure. Additionally, implementing a web application firewall (WAF) and monitoring the system logs for suspicious activity can help to detect and prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the 360 Javascript Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check and nonce exposure on several AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.12. This vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to gain unauthorized access to the system."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "The 360 Javascript Viewer plugin for WordPress has a vulnerability in its capability check and nonce exposure, which can be exploited by authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to gain unauthorized access to the system.", "Business Impact": "This vulnerability can have a significant business impact, as it can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and potentially disrupt the normal functioning of the system.", "Technical Impact": "The technical impact of this vulnerability is that it can allow attackers to bypass the capability check and update the plugin settings without being detected, making it possible for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.", "Mitigation Strategies": "To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to update the 360 Javascript Viewer plugin to the latest version, which has a fixed capability check and nonce exposure.", "Recommendations": "It is recommended that executives implement a WAF and monitor the system logs for suspicious activity to detect and prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.", "Conclusions": "In conclusion, the 360 Javascript Viewer plugin for WordPress has a vulnerability in its capability check and nonce exposure, which can be exploited by authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to gain unauthorized access to the system. It is essential to update the plugin to the latest version and implement additional security measures to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability."}}
