The `\u200eAlertUtil::validateExpression` method evaluates an SpEL expression using `getValue` which by default uses the `StandardEvaluationContext`, allowing the expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as `java.lang.Runtime`, leading to Remote Code Execution. The `/api/v1/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/<expression>` endpoint passes user-controlled data `AlertUtil::validateExpession` allowing authenticated (non-admin) users to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlaying operating system. In addition, there is a missing authorization check since `Authorizer.authorize()` is never called in the affected path and, therefore, any authenticated non-admin user is able to trigger this endpoint and evaluate arbitrary SpEL expressions leading to arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-235`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "OpenMetadata es una plataforma unificada para el descubrimiento, la observabilidad y la gobernanza impulsada por un repositorio central de metadatos, un linaje profundo y una colaboraci\u00f3n fluida en equipo. El m\u00e9todo `?AlertUtil::validateExpression` eval\u00faa una expresi\u00f3n SpEL usando `getValue` que de forma predeterminada usa `StandardEvaluationContext`, permitiendo que la expresi\u00f3n alcance e interact\u00fae con clases Java como `java.lang.Runtime`, lo que lleva al c\u00f3digo remoto Ejecuci\u00f3n. El endpoint `/api/v1/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/` pasa datos controlados por el usuario `AlertUtil::validateExpession`, lo que permite a los usuarios autenticados (no administradores) ejecutar comandos arbitrarios del sistema en el sistema operativo subyacente. Adem\u00e1s, falta una verificaci\u00f3n de autorizaci\u00f3n ya que `Authorizer.authorize()` nunca se llama en la ruta afectada y, por lo tanto, cualquier usuario no administrador autenticado puede activar este endpoint y evaluar expresiones SpEL arbitrarias que conduzcan a la ejecuci\u00f3n de comandos arbitrarios. . Esta vulnerabilidad se descubri\u00f3 con la ayuda de la consulta de inyecci\u00f3n de lenguaje de expresi\u00f3n (Spring) de CodeQL y tambi\u00e9n se rastrea como \"GHSL-2023-235\". Este problema puede provocar la ejecuci\u00f3n remota de c\u00f3digo y se solucion\u00f3 en la versi\u00f3n 1.2.4. Se recomienda a los usuarios que actualicen.
