The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of user modifications by managers or admins, allowing for the modification of all existing attributes of the `user` database entity without proper checks or sanitization. This flaw can be exploited to delete user threads, denying users access to their previously submitted data, or to inject fake threads and/or chat history for social engineering attacks."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "La aplicaci\u00f3n Any-llm de Mintplex-Labs es vulnerable a una neutralizaci\u00f3n inadecuada de elementos especiales utilizados en una declaraci\u00f3n de lenguaje de expresi\u00f3n, identificada en el ID de commit `57984fa85c31988b2eff429adfc654c46e0c342a`.
