However, it could be used as an information gathering technique, where an attacker could use the CVE ID to gather information about the target system or network, including the type of software or hardware being used, and potentially identify unpatched systems. Defending against this technique would involve monitoring network traffic and system logs for unusual activity, as well as implementing strong access controls and monitoring for suspicious login attempts."}], "stix_bundle": "/* Your Stix Bundle Here */", "technical_analysis": {"Introduction": "CVE-2020-12555 is a rejected CVE, indicating that it is not a valid vulnerability.
