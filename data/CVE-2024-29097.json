It allows attackers to inject malicious code that can be executed when a user views their own profile.", "Impact and Scope": "The impact of this vulnerability is medium, with a CVSS score of 6.3. The scope of this vulnerability is limited to the user-profile plugin of WordPress, specifically version 2.0.20 and lower.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this vulnerability are T1190, T1047, and T1210.", "Technical Details": "This vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly sanitize user input in the user-profile plugin. Attackers can inject malicious code into the plugin's user-profile page, which can be executed by the user's browser without any further interaction.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability requires a combination of network traffic analysis, endpoint detection, and web application scanning. The attacker's malicious code can be detected by monitoring for unusual network traffic patterns and endpoint activity.", "Mitigation": "To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to upgrade the user-profile plugin to version 2.0.21 or higher. Additionally, implementing a web application firewall (WAF) can help detect and prevent attacks.", "Conclusion": "The CVE-2024-29097 is a significant vulnerability that requires immediate attention. It is important to take immediate action to mitigate this vulnerability and prevent attacks."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "The CVE-2024-29097 is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the user-profile plugin of WordPress.
