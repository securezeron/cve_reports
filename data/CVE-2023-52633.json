Then, if we happen to get\nthe interrupt after calculating the new time to push to,\nbut before actually finishing that, the interrupt will set\nthe time to a value that's incompatible with the forward,\nand we'll crash because time goes backwards when we do the\nforwarding.\n\nFix this by reading the time_travel_time, calculating the\nadjustment, and doing the adjustment all with interrupts\ndisabled."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "En el kernel de Linux, se ha resuelto la siguiente vulnerabilidad: um: viaje en el tiempo: corrige la corrupci\u00f3n del tiempo En el modo de viaje en el tiempo 'b\u00e1sico' (sin =inf-cpu o =ext), todav\u00eda obtenemos interrupciones del temporizador.
