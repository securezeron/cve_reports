Este problema ocurre cuando se llama a AllocateGlyph() para almacenar nuevos glifos enviados por el cliente al servidor X, lo que potencialmente resulta en m\u00faltiples entradas que apuntan a los mismos glifos no recontados. En consecuencia, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() puede liberar un glifo, lo que lleva a un escenario de use-after-free cuando posteriormente se accede al mismo puntero de glifo.
