This endpoint is at `/api/_nuxt_icon/[name]`. The proxied request path is improperly parsed, allowing an attacker to change the scheme and host of the request. This leads to SSRF, and could potentially lead to sensitive data exposure. The `new URL` constructor is used to parse the final path. This constructor can be passed a relative scheme or path in order to change the host the request is sent to. This constructor is also very tolerant of poorly formatted URLs. As a result we can pass a path prefixed with the string `http:`. This has the effect of changing the scheme to HTTP. We can then subsequently pass a new host, for example `http:127.0.0.1:8080`. This would allow us to send requests to a local server. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.4.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Nuxt es un framework gratuito y de c\u00f3digo abierto para crear sitios web y aplicaciones web completos con Vue.js. `nuxt/icon` proporciona una API para permitir la b\u00fasqueda de iconos del lado del cliente.

Esto conduce a la SSRF y potencialmente podr\u00eda provocar la exposici\u00f3n de datos confidenciales. El constructor \"nueva URL\" se utiliza para analizar la ruta final. A este constructor se le puede pasar un esquema o ruta relativa para cambiar el host al que se env\u00eda la solicitud. Este constructor tambi\u00e9n es muy tolerante con las URL mal formateadas.
