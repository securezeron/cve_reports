An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to perform an SNMP operation using broadcast as the destination address that could be processed by an affected device that is configured with an SNMP server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to communicate to the device on the configured SNMP ports. Although an unauthenticated attacker could send UDP datagrams to the configured SNMP port, only an authenticated user can retrieve or modify data using SNMP requests."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Una vulnerabilidad en el c\u00f3digo de reenv\u00edo UDP del software Cisco IOS XR podr\u00eda permitir que un atacante adyacente no autenticado omita las pol\u00edticas de protecci\u00f3n del plano de administraci\u00f3n configuradas y acceda al servidor del Plano simple de administraci\u00f3n de red (SNMP) de un dispositivo afectado. Esta vulnerabilidad se debe a una programaci\u00f3n incorrecta de reenv\u00edo UDP cuando se utiliza SNMP con protecci\u00f3n del plano de administraci\u00f3n. Un atacante podr\u00eda aprovechar esta vulnerabilidad al intentar realizar una operaci\u00f3n SNMP utilizando la transmisi\u00f3n como direcci\u00f3n de destino que podr\u00eda ser procesada por un dispositivo afectado que est\u00e9 configurado con un servidor SNMP.
