The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.4 with a version of 3.1, attack vector of Network, and attack complexity of Low. The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.14.7.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The techniques related to this vulnerability are TA0003, TA0034, and TA0005. These techniques involve exploiting stored XSS vulnerabilities and using the injected scripts to perform malicious activities.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Pacific widget. An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts by submitting malicious data to the plugin.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability can be done by inspecting the plugin's code for the vulnerability and verifying that the plugin version is affected. Web application scanners can also be used to detect the vulnerability.", "Mitigation": "The mitigation for this vulnerability is to update the plugin to a version greater than 3.14.7 or patch the vulnerability by sanitizing and escaping user input. Limiting access to the plugin's configuration and code to only authorized personnel can also help to prevent the vulnerability.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, this is a serious vulnerability that requires immediate attention. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with Contributor-level access to inject malicious scripts and perform malicious activities. It is recommended to update the plugin to a version greater than 3.14.7 or patch the vulnerability to prevent exploitation."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "The Prime Slider \u2013 Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress has a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "Business Impact": "The vulnerability can be used to steal sensitive information, perform phishing attacks, or execute malicious scripts, which can have a significant impact on the business.", "Technical Impact": "The vulnerability requires a certain level of technical expertise to exploit, and an attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability without valid login credentials.", "Mitigation Strategies": "The mitigation strategies for this vulnerability are to update the plugin to a version greater than 3.14.7, patch the vulnerability, limit access to the plugin's configuration and code, and monitor the plugin's log files for signs of exploitation.", "Recommendations": "It is recommended to update the plugin to a version greater than 3.14.7, patch the vulnerability, limit access to the plugin's configuration and code, and monitor the plugin's log files for signs of exploitation.", "Conclusions": "In conclusion, this vulnerability requires immediate attention.
