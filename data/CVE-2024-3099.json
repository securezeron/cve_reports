This flaw can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) as an authenticated user might not be able to use the intended model, as it will open a different model each time. Additionally, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform data model poisoning by creating a model with the same name, potentially causing an authenticated user to become a victim by using the poisoned model. The issue stems from inadequate validation of model names, allowing for the creation of models with URL-encoded names that are treated as distinct from their URL-decoded counterparts."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Una vulnerabilidad en mlflow/mlflow versi\u00f3n 2.11.1 permite a los atacantes crear m\u00faltiples modelos con el mismo nombre explotando la codificaci\u00f3n URL.
