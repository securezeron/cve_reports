The vulnerability is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit it from anywhere, and it affects any system running Janus WebRTC Server with version 0.10.0 or below.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this vulnerability are T1190 (Staged Buffer Overflow), T1204 (Inadequate Input Validation), and T1505 (Tree Intruder).", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs in the janus_streaming_rtsp_parse_sdp function in the janus_streaming.c file of Janus WebRTC Server. The function does not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to specify a large buffer size and overwrite arbitrary memory locations.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability can be achieved by monitoring system logs for suspicious buffer overflow attempts and analyzing system memory for signs of exploitation.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation strategies for this vulnerability include validating user input and enforcing proper buffer sizes, as well as applying the patch provided by the vendor.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, CVE-2020-14033 is a critical remote buffer overflow vulnerability that affects Janus WebRTC Server with version 0.10.0 or below.
