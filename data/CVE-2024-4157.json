This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. Successful exploitation requires the attacker to have \"View Form\" and \"Manage Form\" permissions, which must be explicitly set by an administrator. However, this requirement can be bypassed when this vulnerability is chained with CVE-2024-2771."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "El complemento Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag &amp; Drop WP Form Builder para WordPress es vulnerable a la inyecci\u00f3n de objetos PHP en todas las versiones hasta la 5.1.15 incluida a trav\u00e9s de la deserializaci\u00f3n de entradas que no son de confianza en la funci\u00f3n extractDynamicValues.
