It was discovered that the cpudata memory from kzalloc() in amd_pstate_epp_cpu_init() is not freed in the analogous exit function, leading to a memory leak.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.5, which is classified as medium severity. It is exploitable locally and allows an attacker to gain higher-level privileges on a system.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The CVE-2024-40997 vulnerability is related to the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques: T1190, T1191, and T1194.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by a memory leak in the cpufreq module, which can be exploited by an attacker to gain higher-level privileges on a system. The attacker must have local access to the system and be able to execute code with elevated privileges.", "Detection": "Detecting this vulnerability requires analyzing system logs for signs of privilege escalation and monitoring for suspicious activity.", "Mitigation": "Mitigating this vulnerability involves updating the Linux kernel to the latest version and configuring the system to prevent local privilege escalation.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the CVE-2024-40997 vulnerability is a local privilege escalation bug in the Linux kernel's cpufreq module. It is exploitable locally and allows an attacker to gain higher-level privileges on a system.
