This is due to the use of loose comparison in the 'verify_id_token' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to an @flutter.io email address or phone number. This also requires firebase to be configured on the website and the user to have set up firebase for their account."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "El complemento MStore API \u2013 Create Native Android &amp; iOS Apps On The Cloud para WordPress es vulnerable a la omisi\u00f3n de autenticaci\u00f3n en versiones hasta la 4.15.2 incluida.
