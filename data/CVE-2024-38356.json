A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE\u2019s content extraction code.

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that, when using the `noneditable_regexp` option, any content within an attribute is properly verified to match the configured regular expression before being added.
