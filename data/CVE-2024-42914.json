The attack vector is Network, and the complexity is Low. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the system.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this CVE are: TA0010, T1186, T1190, and T1552.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs because the forgot password functionality of ArrowCMS version 1.0.0 does not properly validate the host header in the HTTP request. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious host name and direct the request to an attacker-controlled server.", "Detection": "This vulnerability can be detected by monitoring the system for unusual HTTP requests or responses, and by analyzing the host header in the HTTP request.", "Mitigation": "The mitigation for this vulnerability is to update ArrowCMS to a version that properly validates the host header in the HTTP request. Additionally, administrators can modify the system to restrict access to the forgot password functionality and ensure that all HTTP requests are properly validated.", "Conclusion": "The CVE-2024-42914 vulnerability is a significant security risk that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. It is essential to update ArrowCMS and implement additional security measures to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "The CVE-2024-42914 vulnerability is a serious security risk that can affect ArrowCMS version 1.0.0.
