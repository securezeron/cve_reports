The function takes a pointer to a frame structure as an argument and attempts to free the frame using the dev_kfree_skb function. However, if the frame structure is not properly initialized, the function will attempt to free a wild pointer, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.", "Detection": "Signatures can be generated to detect exploitation of the vulnerability by monitoring for suspicious kernel activity, such as unusual frame processing or kernel memory manipulation.", "Mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying patching the Linux kernel and ensuring that devices are configured to only allow trusted devices to connect.", "Conclusion": "CVE-2024-42280 is a significant vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a device.
