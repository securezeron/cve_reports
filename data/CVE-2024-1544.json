Meaning k = r mod n. The division used \nduring the reduction estimates a factor q_e by dividing the upper two \ndigits (a digit having e.g. a size of 8 byte) of r by the upper digit of \nn and then decrements q_e in a loop until it has the correct size. \nObserving the number of times q_e is decremented through a control-flow \nrevealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of \nk. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a \nsignificant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction \nmethods. For SECP160R1, e.g., we find a bias of 15 bits."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Generar el nonce k ECDSA muestra un n\u00famero aleatorio r y luego trunca esta aleatoriedad con una reducci\u00f3n modular mod n donde n es el orden de la curva el\u00edptica. Significado k = r mod n. La divisi\u00f3n utilizada durante la reducci\u00f3n estima un factor q_e dividiendo los dos d\u00edgitos superiores (un d\u00edgito que tiene, por ejemplo, un tama\u00f1o de 8 bytes) de r por el d\u00edgito superior de n y luego disminuye q_e en un bucle hasta que tenga el tama\u00f1o correcto. Observar el n\u00famero de veces que q_e disminuye a trav\u00e9s de un canal lateral revelador de flujo de control revela un sesgo en los bits m\u00e1s significativos de k. Dependiendo de la curva, esto es un sesgo insignificante o un sesgo significativo lo suficientemente grande como para reconstruir k con m\u00e9todos de reducci\u00f3n de celos\u00eda.
