This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, this only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. However, in the formidable settings admins can extend form creation, deletion and other management permissions to other user types, which makes it possible for this vulnerability to be exploited by lower level user types as long as they have been granted the proper permissions."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Formidable Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Survey, Quiz, Payment, Calculator Form &amp; Custom Form Builder complemento para WordPress es vulnerable a Cross-Site Scripting Almacenado a trav\u00e9s de la etiqueta name field y el par\u00e1metro description field label en todas las versiones hasta 6.7 (incluida) debido a una debido a una sanitizaci\u00f3n de entrada y un escape de salida insuficientes.
