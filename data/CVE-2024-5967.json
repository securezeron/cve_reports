The LDAP testing endpoint allows changing the Connection URL\u00a0 independently without re-entering the currently configured LDAP bind credentials.

The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Se encontr\u00f3 una vulnerabilidad en Keycloak.
