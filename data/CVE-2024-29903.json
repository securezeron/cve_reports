Prior to version 2.2.4, maliciously-crafted software artifacts can cause denial of service of the machine running Cosign thereby impacting all services on the machine. The root cause is that Cosign creates slices based on the number of signatures, manifests or attestations in untrusted artifacts. As such, the untrusted artifact can control the amount of memory that Cosign allocates. The exact issue is Cosign allocates excessive memory on the lines that creates a slice of the same length as the manifests. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Cosign proporciona firma de c\u00f3digo y transparencia para contenedores y binarios. Antes de la versi\u00f3n 2.2.4, los artefactos de software creados con fines malintencionados pod\u00edan provocar la denegaci\u00f3n de servicio de la m\u00e1quina que ejecuta Cosign, lo que afectaba a todos los servicios de la m\u00e1quina. La causa principal es que Cosign crea sectores basados en la cantidad de firmas, manifiestos o certificaciones en artefactos que no son de confianza. Como tal, el artefacto que no es de confianza puede controlar la cantidad de memoria que asigna Cosign. El problema exacto es que Cosign asigna memoria excesiva en las l\u00edneas, lo que crea un segmento de la misma longitud que los manifiestos.
