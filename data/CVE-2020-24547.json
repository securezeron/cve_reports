Attackers may use this technique to achieve persistence and maintain access to the compromised system. Defenders should monitor for suspicious PowerShell script execution and implement controls to restrict PowerShell execution."}, {"techniqueID": "T1497", "comment": "This vulnerability may also be used as a pivot point for launching other attacks. Attackers may use this technique to move laterally within the network or exfiltrate sensitive data. Defenders should implement controls to restrict network communication and monitor for unusual network activity."}, {"techniqueID": "T1204", "comment": "The rejected status of this CVE suggests that it may not be a valid vulnerability after all.
