This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.", "Impact and Scope": "This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.2 and affects systems running Ozeki NG SMS Gateway through 4.17.6. It uses a remote attack vector and requires high privileges. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, gain privilege escalation, and access unauthorized data.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The MITRE ATT&CK techniques related to this vulnerability are T1204, T1210, T1190, T1062, and T1134.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of validation on the deserialized data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious .NET serialized files, which are then deserialized by the system, resulting in arbitrary code execution.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability can be achieved through monitoring for unusual network traffic and system behavior. Additionally, file system monitoring can be used to detect and block malicious .NET serialized files.", "Mitigation": "The recommended mitigation for this vulnerability is to upgrade to a version of Ozeki NG SMS Gateway greater than 4.17.6. Additionally, implementing security controls to prevent .NET serialization and deserialization can help to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, CVE-2020-14030 is a serious vulnerability in Ozeki NG SMS Gateway that requires immediate attention and mitigation.
