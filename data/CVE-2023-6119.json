This is caused by GetSusp not correctly protecting a directory that it creates during execution, allowing an attacker to take over file handles used by GetSusp. As this runs with high privileges, the attacker gains elevated permissions. The file handles are opened as read-only. \n\n"}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Una vulnerabilidad de Gesti\u00f3n de Privilegios Inadecuada en Trellix GetSusp anterior a la versi\u00f3n 5.0.0.27 permite a un atacante local con pocos privilegios obtener acceso a archivos que normalmente requieren un nivel de privilegio m\u00e1s alto. Esto se debe a que GetSusp no protege correctamente un directorio que crea durante la ejecuci\u00f3n, lo que permite a un atacante hacerse cargo de los identificadores de archivos utilizados por GetSusp. Como esto se ejecuta con altos privilegios, el atacante obtiene permisos elevados. Los identificadores de archivos se abren como de solo lectura."}], "metrics": {"cvssMetricV31": [{"source": "nvd@nist.gov", "type": "Primary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 5.9}, {"source": "trellixpsirt@trellix.com", "type": "Secondary", "cvssData": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.0, "impactScore": 4.0}]}, "weaknesses": [{"source": "nvd@nist.gov", "type": "Primary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-269"}]}, {"source": "trellixpsirt@trellix.com", "type": "Secondary", "description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-269"}]}], "configurations": [{"nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "cpeMatch": [{"vulnerable": true, "criteria": "cpe:2.3:a:trellix:getsusp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "5.0.0.27", "matchCriteriaId": "AAF002A6-9A8D-4396-98C8-105E59077E70"}]}]}], "references": [{"url": "https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10412", "source": "trellixpsirt@trellix.com", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory"]}], "techniques": [{"techniqueID": "T1562", "comment": "CVE-2023-6119 - This technique is relevant because it involves the exploitation of an improper privilege management vulnerability, which can potentially lead to the gain of elevated permissions."}, {"techniqueID": "T1190", "comment": "CVE-2023-6119 - Abuse of Functionality: This is a relevant technique as it can be used to gain access to files that require high privileges, ultimately leading to the exploitation of the vulnerability."}, {"techniqueID": "T1059", "comment": "CVE-2023-6119 - Command and Control: This technique can be used to establish a command and control channel for the attacker to gain further access and control over the system."}], "stix_bundle": {"objects": [{"id": "vulnerability", "type": "vulnerability", "description": {"lang": "en", "value": "CVE-2023-6119: Improper Privilege Management in Trellix GetSusp"}}, {"id": "tactic", "type": "tactic", "type_label": "Lateral Movement", "description": {"lang": "en", "value": "The attacker will use the vulnerability to gain elevated permissions and move laterally within the network."}}, {"id": "technique", "type": "technique", "type_label": "T1562", "description": {"lang": "en", "value": "The attacker will use an improper privilege management vulnerability to gain elevated permissions."}}, {"id": "course_of_action", "type": "course-of-action", "type_label": "Mitigation", "description": {"lang": "en", "value": "Implement proper privilege management, and restrict access to sensitive files and directories."}, "related_techniques": [{"id": "technique", "idref": "T1562"}]}], "relationships": [{"relationship": "used_by", "id": "vulnerability", "idref": "technique"}, {"relationship": "mitigated_by", "id": "course_of_action", "idref": "technique"}]}, "technical_analysis": {"Introduction": "CVE-2023-6119 is an improper privilege management vulnerability in Trellix GetSusp that allows a local, low-privilege attacker to gain access to files that usually require a higher privilege level.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.8 and an attack vector of LOCAL.
