Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint, it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively, `client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Discourse es una plataforma de c\u00f3digo abierto para el debate comunitario. Sin un l\u00edmite de velocidad en el endpoint POST /uploads, a un atacante le resulta m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil llevar a cabo un ataque DoS en el servidor, ya que crear una carga puede ser un proceso que consume muchos recursos.
