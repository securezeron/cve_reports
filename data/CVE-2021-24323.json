When taxes are enabled, the 'Additional tax classes' field was not properly sanitized, allowing high privilege users to use XSS payloads even when the unfiltered_html parameter is disabled.",
        "Impact and Scope": "The maximum CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.8 (CVSS v3.1) with an attack vector of PUBLIC_ATTACK. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system.",
        "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1030, T1176, T1190",
        "Technical Details": "XSS payloads can be injected in the 'Additional tax classes' field when taxes are enabled. The vulnerability is exploitable even when the unfiltered_html parameter is disabled.",
        "Detection": "Detect potential XSS payloads in the 'Additional tax classes' field. Monitor for unusual or unauthorized changes to the tax classes.",
        "Mitigation": "Validate user input when adding additional tax classes, ensure the system's output is properly sanitized, and restrict access to sensitive functionality.",
        "Conclusion": "CVE-2021-24323 is a high-priority vulnerability that requires immediate attention to prevent exploitation."
