The vulnerability arises due to improper validation of file paths between Windows and Linux environments, allowing attackers to traverse beyond the intended directory and read any file on the Windows system. Specifically, the application fails to adequately sanitize file paths containing backslashes (`\\`), which can be exploited to access the root directory and read, or even delete, sensitive files. This issue was discovered in the context of the `/user_infos` endpoint, where a crafted request using backslashes to reference a file (e.g., `\\windows\\win.ini`) could result in unauthorized file access. The impact of this vulnerability includes the potential for attackers to access sensitive information such as environment variables, database files, and configuration files, which could lead to further compromise of the system."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Existe una vulnerabilidad de path traversal en la aplicaci\u00f3n parisneo/lollms, que afecta a la versi\u00f3n 9.4.0 y potencialmente a versiones anteriores, pero se solucion\u00f3 en la versi\u00f3n 5.9.0. La vulnerabilidad surge debido a una validaci\u00f3n inadecuada de las rutas de archivos entre los entornos Windows y Linux, lo que permite a los atacantes ir m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del directorio deseado y leer cualquier archivo en el sistema Windows. Espec\u00edficamente, la aplicaci\u00f3n no sanitiza adecuadamente las rutas de archivos que contienen barras invertidas (`\\`), que pueden aprovecharse para acceder al directorio ra\u00edz y leer, o incluso eliminar, archivos confidenciales.
