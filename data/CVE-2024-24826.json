An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. In most cases this out of bounds read will result in a crash. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "Exiv2 es una utilidad de l\u00ednea de comandos y una librer\u00eda de C++ para leer, escribir, eliminar y modificar los metadatos de archivos de imagen.
