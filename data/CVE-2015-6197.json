Reason: The CNA or individual who requested this candidate did not associate it with any vulnerability during 2015. Notes: none. This implies that the vulnerability may not be exploitable, making it less likely to be used by attackers. Defending against this is a matter of not relying on this vulnerability."}], "technical_analysis": {"Introduction": "CVE-2015-6197 has been rejected by the security community due to the lack of association with any vulnerability during 2015.
