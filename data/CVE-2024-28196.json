YourSpotify version < 1.9.0 does not prevent other pages from displaying it in an iframe and is thus vulnerable to clickjacking. Clickjacking can be used to trick an existing user of YourSpotify to trigger actions, such as allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account. Clickjacking works by opening the target application in an invisible iframe on an attacker-controlled site and luring a victim to visit the attacker page and interacting with it. By positioning elements over the invisible iframe, a victim can be tricked into triggering malicious or destructive actions in the invisible iframe, while they think they interact with a totally different site altogether. When a victim visits an attacker-controlled site while they are logged into YourSpotify, they can be tricked into performing actions on their YourSpotify instance without their knowledge. These actions include allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account, resulting in a high impact to the integrity of YourSpotify. This issue has been addressed in version 1.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}, {"lang": "es", "value": "your_spotify es un panel de seguimiento de Spotify autohospedado y de c\u00f3digo abierto. La versi\u00f3n de YourSpotify &lt; 1.9.0 no impide que otras p\u00e1ginas la muestren en un iframe y, por lo tanto, es vulnerable al clickjacking. El clickjacking se puede utilizar para enga\u00f1ar a un usuario existente de YourSpotify para que active acciones, como permitir el registro de otros usuarios o eliminar la cuenta de usuario actual. El clickjacking funciona abriendo la aplicaci\u00f3n objetivo en un iframe invisible en un sitio controlado por un atacante y atrayendo a la v\u00edctima para que visite la p\u00e1gina del atacante e interact\u00fae con ella.

The vulnerability exists due to the lack of Clickjacking protection in YourSpotify versions before 1.9.0.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5, with a medium severity rating. It allows an attacker to manipulate the HTTP response and perform malicious actions, such as enabling or disabling the account verification feature.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The vulnerability is related to T1140, T1208, and T1130 MITRE ATT&CK techniques. These techniques involve clickjacking, web page manipulation, and HTTP response splitting attacks.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs when an attacker can manipulate the HTTP response by injecting malicious code into an iframe. This allows the attacker to trick the user into performing malicious actions, such as enabling or disabling the account verification feature.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability can be done by monitoring the HTTP response for any suspicious or malicious activity. Additionally, implementing Clickjacking protection mechanisms like the X-Frame-Options header can help detect attempts to manipulate the HTTP response.", "Mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading YourSpotify to a version greater than 1.9.0, which implements Clickjacking protection. Additionally, implementing input validation and sanitization can help prevent HTTP response splitting attacks.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, CVE-2024-28196 is a significant vulnerability that allows clickjacking attacks. Defenders should upgrade to a patched version of YourSpotify and implement additional security measures to prevent these types of attacks."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "CVE-2024-28196 is a vulnerability in an open-source, self-hosted Spotify tracking dashboard that allows clickjacking attacks.
