This vulnerability exists because the QuantConnect Lean versions from 2.3.0.0 to 2.4.0.1 do not properly configure the 'TypeNameHandling' property in the Json.NET library.", "Impact and Scope": "This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 with a version 3.1 attack vector. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code and can be used to accomplish post-exploitation activities such as data exfiltration.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1002, T1055, T1077", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-controlled data. The 'TypeNameHandling' property in the Json.NET library is not properly configured, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability is challenging as it relies on the attacker to exploit the vulnerability in a way that creates a detectable signature. However, detection can be improved through use of behavioral detection systems that can identify abnormal system behavior.", "Mitigation": "The mitigation for this vulnerability is to upgrade to a version of QuantConnect Lean that properly configures the 'TypeNameHandling' property in the Json.NET library. Additionally, configuring the 'TypeNameHandling' property to 'None' can also mitigate the vulnerability.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, CVE-2020-20136 is a severe vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. It is essential to upgrade to a patched version of QuantConnect Lean to mitigate this vulnerability."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "CVE-2020-20136 is a critical vulnerability in QuantConnect Lean that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.", "Business Impact": "The business impact of this vulnerability is significant as it can be used to steal sensitive financial information and disrupt financial trading activities.", "Technical Impact": "The technical impact of this vulnerability is high as it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code and can be used to accomplish post-exploitation activities such as data exfiltration.", "Mitigation Strategies": "The mitigation strategy for this vulnerability is to upgrade to a patched version of QuantConnect Lean and configure the 'TypeNameHandling' property to 'None'.", "Recommendations": "Executives should recommend upgrading to a patched version of QuantConnect Lean and configuring the 'TypeNameHandling' property to 'None' to mitigate this vulnerability.", "Conclusions": "In conclusion, CVE-2020-20136 is a critical vulnerability that requires immediate attention and mitigation."}}
