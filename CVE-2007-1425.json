This can be exploited by using the list parameter in an archive action, which bypasses the input validation and allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability can be done by looking for suspicious SQL queries, such as those containing the list parameter. Additionally, logging and monitoring of database activity can help detect and identify suspicious activity.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation of this vulnerability can be done by updating to the latest version of the Triexa SonicMailer Pro software, which includes the necessary patches to fix the vulnerability. Additionally, parameterized queries and input validation should be used to prevent SQL injection attacks.", "Conclusion": "The Triexa SonicMailer Pro 3.2.3 SQL injection vulnerability is a significant security risk that can be exploited by remote attackers.
