The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the za_file parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files in the web server.", "Impact and Scope": "The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.6 (High) and allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. The attack vector is network-based, and the complexity is low.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The vulnerability is related to several MITRE ATT&CK techniques, including PHP File Inclusion (T1190), Remote File Inclusion (T1027), and File and Directory Discovery (T1086).", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the za_file parameter. An attacker can send a crafted za_file parameter to include arbitrary files in the web server, allowing them to read sensitive information.", "Detection": "Detection of the vulnerability can be done by monitoring server logs for unusual file access or by using vulnerability scanners to detect file inclusion vulnerabilities.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation of the vulnerability can be done by updating the Zip Attachments plugin to a version that is not vulnerable, or by disabling the plugin if it is not necessary.", "Conclusion": "The CVE-2015-4694 vulnerability is a high-severity vulnerability that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.
