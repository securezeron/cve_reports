The vulnerability is remote, meaning that an attacker only needs to persuade a vulnerable system to make a request to a malicious server in order to exploit the vulnerability.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this vulnerability are T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application, and T1409: Web Application Scanning.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine that is used by Google Chrome. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious JavaScript code that causes a buffer overflow, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.", "Detection": "The vulnerability can be detected by monitoring for suspicious JavaScript code execution, as well as by monitoring for systems that are running older versions of Google Chrome and Google V8.", "Mitigation": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating Google Chrome and Google V8 to the latest version, as well as by disabling JavaScript execution in Google Chrome.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the CVE-2015-6580 vulnerability is a high-severity remote code execution vulnerability in Google Chrome and Google V8 that can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
