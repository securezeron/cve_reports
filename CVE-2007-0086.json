The vulnerability affects all versions of WebEx and is exploitable via HTTP requests.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "T1071, T1078", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability is caused by the way WebEx handles HTTP requests with a Range header. When a request is made with a Range header, WebEx attempts to read the requested bytes from the server. If the Range header specifies a large number of bytes, WebEx will consume a large amount of bandwidth, eventually causing a denial of service.", "Detection": "This vulnerability can be detected by monitoring network traffic for large HTTP requests with a Range header.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation for this vulnerability is to limit the number of bytes that can be read from the server in a single request.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the Cisco WebEx Vulnerability is a serious vulnerability that can cause a denial of service attack on the WebEx server. It is important to mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the number of bytes that can be read from the server in a single request."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "The Cisco WebEx Vulnerability is a serious vulnerability that can cause a denial of service attack on the WebEx server.", "Business Impact": "This vulnerability can cause significant productivity losses and revenue losses.", "Technical Impact": "This vulnerability can cause a denial of service attack on the WebEx server, which can lead to data loss and corruption.", "Mitigation Strategies": "Mitigate this vulnerability by limiting the number of bytes that can be read from the server in a single request.", "Recommendations": "Recommend that WebEx server administrators take immediate action to mitigate this vulnerability.", "Conclusions": "In conclusion, the Cisco WebEx Vulnerability is a serious vulnerability that requires immediate attention and mitigation."}}
