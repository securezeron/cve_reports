This vulnerability affects all versions of IIS 4.0 and can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP 1.0 request for a web page protected by basic authentication and with no realm defined.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The related MITRE ATT&CK techniques for this vulnerability are T1047: Software updates, T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application, T1065: System Net Work-BIOS, and T1041: Network Sniffing.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs because IIS 4.0 does not properly handle HTTP 1.0 requests protected by basic authentication and with no realm defined. This allows remote attackers to obtain the internal IP address of the server by sending a crafted HTTP 1.0 request.", "Detection": "To detect this vulnerability, network traffic should be monitored for HTTP 1.0 requests protected by basic authentication and with no realm defined. Firewall rules should be updated to block such requests.", "Mitigation": "The mitigation strategy for this vulnerability is to install software updates for IIS 4.0. This will patch the vulnerability and prevent remote attackers from obtaining the internal IP address of the server.", "Conclusion": "In conclusion, CVE-2000-0649 is a vulnerability in IIS 4.0 that allows remote attackers to obtain the internal IP address of the server. This vulnerability can be mitigated by installing software updates for IIS 4.0 and monitoring network traffic for suspicious HTTP 1.0 requests."}, "executive_analysis": {"Overview": "CVE-2000-0649 is a vulnerability in IIS 4.0 that allows remote attackers to obtain the internal IP address of the server. This vulnerability poses a low risk but can still compromise the security of the server.", "Business Impact": "The business impact of this vulnerability is low unless the server contains sensitive data that should not be accessible to remote attackers.", "Technical Impact": "The technical impact of this vulnerability is the compromise of the server's internal IP address, which may allow remote attackers to gain unauthorized access to the server.", "Mitigation Strategies": "The recommended mitigation strategy for this vulnerability is to install software updates for IIS 4.0 and monitor network traffic for suspicious HTTP 1.0 requests.", "Recommendations": "Executives are recommended to prioritize software updates for IIS 4.0 and implement additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the server.", "Conclusions": "In conclusion, CVE-2000-0649 is a vulnerability in IIS 4.0 that allows remote attackers to obtain the internal IP address of the server. To mitigate this vulnerability, software updates should be installed and network traffic should be monitored for suspicious HTTP 1.0 requests."}}
