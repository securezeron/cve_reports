It allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files and can be used to escalate privileges.", "Related MITRE ATT&CK Techniques": "The following MITRE ATT&CK techniques are related to this vulnerability: T1190, T1036, T1083.", "Technical Details": "The vulnerability occurs when the Archive::Tar Perl module does not properly validate the path and name of the files in a TAR archive. This allows an attacker to specify a path that is outside of the working directory, allowing them to access and modify sensitive files.", "Detection": "Detection of this vulnerability involves monitoring for unintended file access and modification. It also involves monitoring for suspicious TAR archive files and inspecting them for unusual paths and file names.", "Mitigation": "Mitigation of this vulnerability involves patching the Archive::Tar Perl module to a version that fixes the vulnerability. It also involves validating the paths and file names in TAR archives and restricting access to sensitive files.", "Conclusion": "CVE-2007-4829 is a serious vulnerability that can be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files.
